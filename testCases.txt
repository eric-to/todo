If this were a production app:
1. I would use a database for storing todos and check for persistency in the app (do the todos persist
throughout the day and reset at the correct time).
2. Test for responsiveness on various, possibly obscurely sized devices.
3. For security flaws.
4. Performance. Are there any issues when there's thousands of todos on the list. Will it effect
consequent adding and completion of todos?
